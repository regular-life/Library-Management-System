# Library Management System

## Introduction
This is a simple readme document to help you understand the Library Management System implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application allows users to interact with a library system as either a librarian or a member. It was developed using IntelliJ IDEA and Maven.

## How to Run the Application
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
   - IntelliJ IDEA with Maven.

2. **Cloning the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/regular-life/AP-Assignments.git
     ```
     **OR**
   - Download the .zip file from https://github.com/regular-life/AP-Assignments.

3. **Opening the Project in IntelliJ:**
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Click on "File" -> "Open" and select the project directory you just cloned.

4. **Running the Application:**
   - Locate the `Main.java` file in the project.
   - Right-click on `Main.java` and select `Run Main.main()`.

5. **Using the Application:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to use the Library Management System as either a librarian or a member.

## Features
Here are the key features of the Library Management System:

1. **Add Book:**
   - Allows librarians to add a new book to the library.
   - Takes input for book details (title, author, total copies).

2. **Remove Book:**
   - Allows librarians to remove a book from the library.
   - Takes input for book ID.

3. **Register Member:**
   - Allows librarians to add a new member to the library.
   - Takes input for member details (name, age, phone number).

4. **Remove Member:**
   - Allows librarians to remove a member from the library.
   - Takes input for member ID.

5. **Enter as a Member:**
   - Takes the member's name and phone number as input.
   - Logs in as the particular member, if already registered.

6. **Issue Book:**
   - Allows members to borrow a book from the library, given their penalty amount is zero.
   - Displays available books and takes input for book ID.

7. **Return Book:**
   - Allows members to return a borrowed book.
   - Displays borrowed books and takes input for book ID.

8. **List Books:**
   - Displays a list of all available books in the library.

9. **List Members:**
   - Displays a list of all registered members of the library.

10. **Calculate Fine:**
    - Calculates and displays the fine amount for a book if it's returned after the due date (10 days).

11. **Exit:**
    - Terminates the application.


## User Guide
1. **Librarian Interface:**
   - To use the librarian interface, choose "Enter as a librarian" from the main menu.
   - Follow the prompts to perform librarian-specific actions.

2. **Member Interface:**
   - To use the member interface, choose "Enter as a member" from the main menu.
   - Provide your name and phone number to log in as a member.
   - Follow the prompts to perform member-specific actions.

3. **General Instructions:**
   - Input validation is implemented to handle incorrect or invalid user inputs.
   - Proper error messages are displayed to guide the user.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into two main classes: `Book` and `Member`. These classes represent the entities within the library system. The `Main` class contains the main program logic and user interface.

### Class: Book

   1. **Attributes:**
      - `title` (String): The title of the book.
      - `author` (String): The author of the book.
      - `book_id` (int): An identifier for the book.
      - `status` (int): Represents the status of the book (0 for available, current time(in seconds) for issued books).
  2. **Constructor:**
     The Book class has a constructor that initializes the book's attributes when a new book object is created.
      ```cpp
          Book(String title, String author, int book_id)
          {
              this.title = title ;
              this.author = author ;
              this.book_id = book_id ;
              this.status = 0 ;
          }
      ```

### Class: Member
  1. **Attributes:**
     - `name` (String): The name of the member.
     - `phone` (String): The phone number of the member.
     - `member_id` (int): An identifier for the member.
     - `fine` (int): Represents the fine amount associated with the member. Fine of â‚¹ 3/day is charged for every day after 10 days. (NOTE: The program is made so that 1s in real world equals 1 day for the program.)
     - `age` (int): The age of the member.
     - `books_issued_id` (Vector<Book>): A collection of books issued by the member.
  2. **Constructor:**
     The Member class has a constructor that initializes the member's attributes when a new member object is created.
     ```cpp
     Member(String name, String phone, int member_id, int age)
     {
         this.name = name ;
         this.phone = phone ;
         this.member_id = member_id ;
         this.books_issued_id = new Vector<Book>() ;
         this.fine = 0 ;
         this.age = age ;
     }
     ```
  3. **Methods:**
     The Member class contains several methods to interact with the library system:
     - `issueBook(Vector<Book> List_Books)`: Allows a member to issue a book if they meet certain conditions (no outstanding fine and number of books already issued is not more than one).
     - `returnBook(Vector<Book> List_Books)`: Allows a member to return a book and calculate fines if it's returned after the due date.
     - `listMyBooks()`: Lists the books issued by the member.
     - `payFine()`: Allows the member to pay any outstanding fines.
